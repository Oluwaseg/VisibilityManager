# How to Obtain a GitHub Personal Access Token

GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs) are used to authenticate and authorize access to your GitHub account. This guide will walk you through the steps to obtain a PAT for use with applications and scripts.

## Steps to Obtain a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. **Log In to GitHub**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account.

2. **Navigate to Settings**
   - In the top-right corner of the page, click your profile picture, then select **Settings** from the dropdown menu.

3. **Access Developer Settings**
   - On the left sidebar, scroll down and click **Developer settings**.

4. **Go to Personal Access Tokens**
   - Click **Personal access tokens** in the left sidebar.

5. **Generate a New Token**
   - Click the **Generate new token** button.

6. **Set Token Description and Expiration**
   - Provide a **Note** (description) for your token. This helps you remember what the token is used for.
   - Set an expiration for the token if desired. Tokens with an expiration are more secure.

7. **Select Scopes and Permissions**
   - Choose the scopes and permissions for your token based on the actions you want to perform. Common scopes include:
     - **repo**: Full control of private repositories
     - **read:org**: Read-only access to organization information
   - For more detailed information on scopes, refer to [GitHubâ€™s documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

8. **Generate and Copy the Token**
   - Click **Generate token** at the bottom of the page.
   - **Important**: Copy the generated token and store it securely. You will not be able to see it again after leaving the page.

9. **Use the Token**
   - Use your new token in your applications, scripts, or wherever authentication is required.

## Security Tips

- **Keep Your Token Secure**: Treat your token like a password. Do not share it or expose it in public repositories.
- **Use Environment Variables**: Store tokens in environment variables rather than hard-coding them into your applications.
- **Regenerate Tokens Regularly**: Periodically regenerate tokens and update your applications accordingly.
- **Revoke Compromised Tokens**: If you believe your token has been compromised, revoke it immediately from the [Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) page.

## Important Note

Please remember that this application does not store any tokens. Your token is used temporarily during operations and is not saved in any form. Ensure you handle your token securely and do not share it.
